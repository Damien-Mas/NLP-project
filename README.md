# NLP-project

This project features an analysis of the “blog authorship corpus” which dataset can be downloaded
downloaded at the following URL:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/blog-authorship-corpus

The dataset itself could not be included in the zip file as it is too big for the submission. If you wish
to run any of the programs/notebooks which I have submitted, the dataset should be downloaded
and unzipped in the “data” folder.

As explained in the critical report for the NLP project, I could only analyse several “slice” of blog
corpus for this project as my computer resources are fairly limited. This is why this folder features
several notebook. For instance the file named:

NLP_assignment_9_30000_35000entries_commented.ipynb

features an analysis of the blog entries within the corpus, going from entry 30000 to 35000 for BoW
TF, and TF-IDF (these terms are explained in the critical essay). The file named:

NLP_assignment_9_35000_36000entries_commented.ipynb

features an analysis of the blog entries within the corpus, going from entry 35000 to 36000 for BoW
TF, and TF-IDF. And so on…

Please note that the file named NLP_assignment_9-LDA.ipynb, features an LDA analysis of the
corpus.
